# Dotfiles

Feel Welcome to use configs/dotfiles as you please. But just to let you know, this repo is mostly for helping me migrate between computers so there will be some useless stuff.

### Directory structure
I like separating configs into smaller files and putting them in directories.

I also don't really like having a cluttered home directory so I will place most dotfiles in the config folder.

### Install script
**Don't use it**. Seriously it's a few lines of bash and all it does is putting symlinks in appropriate places.  
Meant only for fresh installs.
