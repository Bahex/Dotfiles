# Dotfiles

Feel Welcome to use configs/dotfiles as you please. But just to let you know, this repo is mostly for helping me migrate between computers so there will be some useless stuff.

### Directory structure
I like separating configs into smaller files and putting them in directories.

I also don't really like having a cluttered home directory so I will place most dotfiles in the config folder.
